                With a team of engineers, scientists and educators, Inventors' Workshops provides curated information in different medias, 
                access to spaces, activities and passion-driven communities to learners and change-makers who want to efficiently learn 
                what they're passionate about and apply it to accomplish their dreams. Unlike just searching in Google for all resources 
                you need, we centralize them into one concise environment that reduces the search overhead and connects the passion-driven 
                community.
